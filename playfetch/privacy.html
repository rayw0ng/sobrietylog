  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p><strong>PlayFetch</strong> ("the App") respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information. All data you create remains stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Purchases and Free Trial</h2>
  <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock all features. Users are provided with a 3-day free trial to experience the full functionality of the App. After the trial period, a single purchase is required to continue using the full features. Payment is securely processed through the App Store. The App itself does not process or store any payment information.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since all your data is stored only on your device, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your own device.</p>

  <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
